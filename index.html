              <p class content="content-div">
                I was blessed to grow up in a small town called Yucaipa because I was always just an hour away from either the mountains or the beach. I attended Gorman Learning Center through my high school years and 
                graduated with a 4.0 GPA as well as Honors. Throughout my middle and high school years I took part in various volunteer activities such as assisting in the care of horses at Bella Vista Ranch, reading 
                to the residents of the Highland Care Center of Redlands, and aiding in the construction the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses. These experiences were very rewarding and they helped me to see the 
                importance of a self-sacrificing spirit and supported the validity to the statement that "there is more happiness in giving than receiving". (Acts 20:35)
