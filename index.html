        <p> I love working as part of a team and collaborating with others to solve problems that arise. My goal is to give back to my 
          community in any way I can as a thank you to all those including teachers and mentors, that have helped me become the person I am today.</p>

              <p>
                I attended Gorman Learning Center through my high school years and graduated with a 4.0 GPA as well as Honors.  Throughout my middle and high school years, I took part in various volunteer activities such as assisting in the care of horses at Bella Vista Ranch, reading to the residents of the Highland Care Center of Redlands, and aiding in the renovation/construction of the local Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses. These experiences were very rewarding and they helped me to see the importance of a self-sacrificing spirit and supported the validity to the statement that "there is more happiness in giving than receiving". (Acts 20:35)
